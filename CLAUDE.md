For all Python-related work:

Before running, suggesting, or generating any Python commands:
1. Check whether a virtual environment is active (e.g., $VIRTUAL_ENV).
2. If none exists, create one at .venv using `python3 -m venv .venv`.
3. Activate the virtual environment before proceeding.
4. Never install Python packages globally.
5. If a virtual environment is not active, stop and create/activate it first.
